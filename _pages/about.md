Hi! I am a hydroclimate scientist specializing in the dynamics of the global water cycle and its interactions with land and human systems. I utilize satellite remote sensing, physical/climate models, and AI techniquesto generate actionable solutions for sustainable water management and food security.
 
 I am currently a postdoctoral Scholar working with [Prof. Jennifer Burney](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/people/jennifer-burney) in the School of Global Policy & Strategy and Scripps Institution of Oceanorgraphy at UC San Diego. My current research focuses on Climate Impacts and Food Security:
 - Vulnerability Diagnostics: Tracing rainwater sources using satellite-based water isotopes to pinpoint regions of high agricultural risk.

- Precision Monitoring: Mapping crop phenology at high resolution (up to 30m) to enhance responses to subseasonal hazards like drought and temperature whiplash.

- Mitigation Solutions: Exploring actionable hazard adaptation and mitigation strategies through optimized land use management (e.g., the trade-offs between forest loss and cropland expansion).

 I completed my PhD in Atmospheric Science from the University at Albany, SUNY under the supervision of [Prof. Liming Zhou](https://www.albany.edu/daes/faculty/liming-zhou). My stories about the water cycle stacked up over the Congo Basin, were taught by my undergraduate advisors Prof. Song Yang and Prof. Xiaomin Hu at [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://atmos.sysu.edu.cn/), were ingenuiely inspired as a kid growing up in Guilin (桂林), a city entitled "By water, by mountains, most lovely, Guilin" (山水甲天下) in southern China.
